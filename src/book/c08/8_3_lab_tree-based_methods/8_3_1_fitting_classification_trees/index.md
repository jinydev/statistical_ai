# _8.3.1 Fitting Classification Trees_ 

We first use classification trees to analyze the `Carseats` data set. In these data, `Sales` is a continuous variable, and so we begin by recoding it as a binary variable. We use the `where()` function to create a variable, called `where() High` , which takes on a value of `Yes` if the `Sales` variable exceeds 8, and takes on a value of `No` otherwise. 

```
In [3]:Carseats=load_data('Carseats')
High=np.where(Carseats.Sales>8,
"Yes",
"No")
```

We now use `DecisionTreeClassifier()` to fit a classification tree in order `DecisionTree` to predict `High` using all variables but `Sales` . To do so, we must form a `Classifier()` model matrix as we did when fitting regression models. 

```
In [4]:model=MS(Carseats.columns.drop('Sales'),intercept=False)
D=model.fit_transform(Carseats)
feature_names=list(D.columns)
X=np.asarray(D)
```

We have converted `D` from a data frame to an array `X` , which is needed in some of the analysis below. We also need the `feature_names` for annotating our plots later. 

There are several options needed to specify the classifier, such as `max_depth` (how deep to grow the tree), `min_samples_split` (minimum number of observations in a node to be eligible for splitting) and `criterion` (whether to use Gini or cross-entropy as the split criterion). We also set `random_state` for reproducibility; ties in the split criterion are broken at random. 

```
In [5]:clf=DTC(criterion='entropy',
max_depth=3,
random_state=0)
clf.fit(X,High)
```

```
Out[5]:DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy',max_depth=3)
```

In our discussion of qualitative features in Section 3.3, we noted that for a linear regression model such a feature could be represented by including a matrix of dummy variables (one-hot-encoding) in the model matrix, using the formula notation of `statsmodels` . As mentioned in Section 8.1, there is a more natural way to handle qualitative features when building a decision tree, that does not require such dummy variables; each split amounts to partitioning the levels into two groups. However, the `sklearn` implementation of decision trees does not take advantage of this approach; instead it simply treats the one-hot-encoded levels as separate variables. 

```
In [6]:accuracy_score(High,clf.predict(X))
```
