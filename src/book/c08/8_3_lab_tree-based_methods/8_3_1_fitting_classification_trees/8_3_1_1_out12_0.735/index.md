# **`Out[12]:`** `0.735` 

Next we use the `cost_complexity_pruning_path()` method of `clf` to extract `cost_` cost-complexity values. 

```
complexity_
pruning_
path()
```

```
In [13]:ccp_path=clf.cost_complexity_pruning_path(X_train,High_train)
kfold=skm.KFold(10,
random_state=1,
shuffle=True)
```

This yields a set of impurities and _α_ values from which we can extract an optimal one by cross-validation. 

```
In [14]:grid=skm.GridSearchCV(clf,
{'ccp_alpha':ccp_path.ccp_alphas},
refit=True,
```

cv=kfold,
scoring='accuracy')
grid.fit(X_train,High_train)
grid.best_score_
```

```
Out[14]:0.685
```

Let’s take a look at the pruned true. 

```
In [15]:ax=subplots(figsize=(12,12))[1]
best_=grid.best_estimator_
plot_tree(best_,
feature_names=feature_names ,
ax=ax);
```

This is quite a bushy tree. We could count the leaves, or query `best_` instead. 

```
In [16]:best_.tree_.n_leaves
```

```
Out[16]:30
```

The tree with 30 terminal nodes results in the lowest cross-validation error rate, with an accuracy of 68.5%. How well does this pruned tree perform on the test data set? Once again, we apply the `predict()` function. 

```
In [17]:print(accuracy_score(High_test,
best_.predict(X_test)))
confusion=confusion_table(best_.predict(X_test),
High_test)
confusion
```

```
Out[17]:0.72
```

```

Now 72.0% of the test observations are correctly classified, which is slightly worse than the error for the full tree (with 35 leaves). So crossvalidation has not helped us much here; it only pruned off 5 leaves, at a cost of a slightly worse error. These results would change if we were to change the random number seeds above; even though cross-validation gives an unbiased approach to model selection, it does have variance. 

_8.3.2 Fitting Regression Trees_ 

Here we fit a regression tree to the `Boston` data set. The steps are similar to those for classification trees. 

```
In [18]:Boston=load_data("Boston")
model=MS(Boston.columns.drop('medv'),intercept=False)
D=model.fit_transform(Boston)
feature_names=list(D.columns)
X=np.asarray(D)
```

8.3 Lab: Tree-Based Methods 359 

First, we split the data into training and test sets, and fit the tree to the training data. Here we use 30% of the data for the test set. 

```
In [19]:(X_train,
X_test,
y_train,
y_test)=skm.train_test_split(X,
Boston['medv'],
test_size=0.3,
random_state=0)
```

Having formed our training and test data sets, we fit the regression tree. 

```
In [20]:reg=DTR(max_depth=3)
reg.fit(X_train,y_train)
ax=subplots(figsize=(12,12))[1]
plot_tree(reg,
feature_names=feature_names ,
ax=ax);
```

The variable `lstat` measures the percentage of individuals with lower socioeconomic status. The tree indicates that lower values of `lstat` correspond to more expensive houses. The tree predicts a median house price of $12,042 for small-sized homes ( `rm < 6.8` ), in suburbs in which residents have low socioeconomic status ( `lstat > 14.4` ) and the crime-rate is moderate ( `crim > 5.8` ). 

Now we use the cross-validation function to see whether pruning the tree will improve performance. 

```
In [21]:ccp_path=reg.cost_complexity_pruning_path(X_train,y_train)
kfold=skm.KFold(5,
shuffle=True,
random_state=10)
grid=skm.GridSearchCV(reg,
{'ccp_alpha':ccp_path.ccp_alphas},
refit=True,
cv=kfold,
scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
G=grid.fit(X_train,y_train)
```

In keeping with the cross-validation results, we use the pruned tree to make predictions on the test set. **`In [22]:`** `best_ = grid.best_estimator_ np.mean((y_test - best_.predict(X_test))**2)` 

```
Out[22]:28.07
```

In other words, the test set $\text{MSE}$ associated with the regression tree is 28.07. The square root of the $\text{MSE}$ is therefore around 5.30, indicating that this model leads to test predictions that are within around $5300 of the true median home value for the suburb. 

Let’s plot the best tree to see how interpretable it is. 

```
In [23]:ax=subplots(figsize=(12,12))[1]
plot_tree(G.best_estimator_ ,
feature_names=feature_names ,
ax=ax);
```
