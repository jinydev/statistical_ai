# _2.3.6 Indexing Data_

To begin, we create a two-dimensional `numpy` array.

```python
In [56]: A = np.array(np.arange(16)).reshape((4, 4))
         A
Out[56]: array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
                [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
                [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
                [12, 13, 14, 15]])
```

Typing `A[1, 2]` retrieves the element corresponding to the second row and third column. (As usual, `Python` indexes from 0.)

```python
In [57]: A[1, 2]
Out[57]: 6
```

The first number after the open-bracket symbol `[` refers to the row, and the second number refers to the column.

## Indexing Rows, Columns, and Submatrices

To select multiple rows at a time, we can pass in a list specifying our selection. For instance, `[1, 3]` will retrieve the second and fourth rows:

```python
In [58]: A[[1, 3]]
Out[58]: array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],
                [12, 13, 14, 15]])
```

To select the first and third columns, we pass in `[0, 2]` as the second argument in the square brackets. In this case we need to supply the first argument `:` which selects all rows.

```python
In [59]: A[:, [0, 2]]
Out[59]: array([[ 0,  2],
                [ 4,  6],
                [ 8, 10],
                [12, 14]])
```

Now, suppose that we want to select the submatrix made up of the second and fourth rows as well as the first and third columns. This is where indexing gets slightly tricky. It is natural to try to use lists to retrieve the rows and columns:

```python
In [60]: A[[1, 3], [0, 2]]
Out[60]: array([ 4, 14])
```

Oops — what happened? We got a one-dimensional array of length two identical to

```python
In [61]: np.array([A[1, 0], A[3, 2]])
Out[61]: array([ 4, 14])
```

Similarly, the following code fails to extract the submatrix comprised of the second and fourth rows and the first, third, and fourth columns:

```python
In [62]: A[[1, 3], [0, 2, 3]]
IndexError: shape mismatch: indexing arrays could not be broadcast
            together with shapes (2,) (3,)
```

We can see what has gone wrong here. When supplied with two indexing lists, the `numpy` interpretation is that these provide pairs of _i, j_ indices for a series of entries. That is why the pair of lists must have the same length. However, that was not our intent, since we are looking for a submatrix.

One easy way to do this is as follows. We first create a submatrix by subsetting the rows of `A`, and then on the fly we make a further submatrix by subsetting its columns.

```python
In [63]: A[[1, 3]][:, [0, 2]]
Out[63]: array([[ 4,  6],
                [12, 14]])
```

There are more efficient ways of achieving the same result. The _convenience function_ `np.ix_()` allows us to extract a submatrix using lists, by creating an intermediate _mesh_ object.

```python
In [64]: idx = np.ix_([1, 3], [0, 2, 3])
         A[idx]
Out[64]: array([[ 4,  6,  7],
                [12, 14, 15]])
```

Alternatively, we can subset matrices efficiently using slices. The slice `1:4:2` captures the second and fourth items of a sequence, while the slice `0:3:2` captures the first and third items (the third element in a slice sequence is the step size).

```python
In [65]: A[1:4:2, 0:3:2]
Out[65]: array([[ 4,  6],
                [12, 14]])
```

Why are we able to retrieve a submatrix directly using slices but not using lists? Its because they are different `Python` types, and are treated differently by `numpy`. Slices can be used to extract objects from arbitrary sequences, such as strings, lists, and tuples, while the use of lists for indexing is more limited.

## Boolean Indexing

In `numpy`, a _Boolean_ is a type that equals either `True` or `False` (also represented as 1 and 0, respectively). The next line creates a vector of 0’s, represented as Booleans, of length equal to the first dimension of `A`.

```python
In [66]: keep_rows = np.zeros(A.shape[0], bool)
         keep_rows
Out[66]: array([False, False, False, False])
```

We now set two of the elements to `True`.

```python
In [67]: keep_rows[[1, 3]] = True
         keep_rows
Out[67]: array([False,  True, False,  True])
```

Note that the elements of `keep_rows`, when viewed as integers, are the same as the values of `np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])`. Below, we use `==` to verify their equality. When applied to two arrays, the `==` operation is applied elementwise.

```python
In [68]: np.all(keep_rows == np.array([0, 1, 0, 1]))
Out[68]: True
```

(Here, the function `np.all()` has checked whether all entries of an array are `True`. A similar function, `np.any()`, can be used to check whether any entries of an array are `True`.)

However, even though `np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])` and `keep_rows` are equal according to `==`, they index different sets of rows! The former retrieves the first, second, first, and second rows of `A`.

```python
In [69]: A[np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])]
Out[69]: array([[0, 1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6, 7],
                [0, 1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6, 7]])
```

By contrast, `keep_rows` retrieves only the second and fourth rows of `A` — i.e. the rows for which the Boolean equals `True`.

```python
In [70]: A[keep_rows]
Out[70]: array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],
                [12, 13, 14, 15]])
```

This example shows that Booleans and integers are treated differently by `numpy`.

We again make use of the `np.ix_()` function to create a mesh containing the second and fourth rows, and the first, third, and fourth columns. This time, we apply the function to Booleans, rather than lists.

```python
In [71]: keep_cols = np.zeros(A.shape[1], bool)
         keep_cols[[0, 2, 3]] = True
         idx_bool = np.ix_(keep_rows, keep_cols)
         A[idx_bool]
Out[71]: array([[ 4,  6,  7],
                [12, 14, 15]])
```

We can also mix a list with an array of Booleans in the arguments to `np.ix_()`:

```python
In [72]: idx_mixed = np.ix_([1, 3], keep_cols)
         A[idx_mixed]
Out[72]: array([[ 4,  6,  7],
                [12, 14, 15]])
```
