# 11.3 The Kaplan–Meier Survival Curve 

The _survival curve_ , or _survival function_ , is defined as 

$$
S(t) = \Pr(T > t)
$$

survival curve survival function 

This decreasing function quantifies the probability of surviving past time _t_ . For example, suppose that a company is interested in modeling customer churn. Let _T_ represent the time that a customer cancels a subscription to the company’s service. Then _S_ ( _t_ ) represents the probability that a customer cancels later than time _t_ . The larger the value of _S_ ( _t_ ), the less likely that the customer will cancel before time _t_ . 

In this section, we will consider the task of estimating the survival curve. Our investigation is motivated by the `BrainCancer` dataset, which contains the survival times for patients with primary brain tumors undergoing treatment with stereotactic radiation methods.[2] The predictors are `gtv` (gross tumor volume, in cubic centimeters); `sex` (male or female); `diagnosis` (meningioma, LG glioma, HG glioma, or other); `loc` (the tumor location: either infratentorial or supratentorial); `ki` (Karnofsky index); and `stereo` (stereotactic method: either stereotactic radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, abbreviated as SRS and SRT, respectively). Only 53 of the 88 patients were still alive at the end of the study. 

Now, we consider the task of estimating the survival curve (11.2) for these data. To estimate _S_ (20) = Pr( _T >_ 20), the probability that a patient survives for at least _t_ = 20 months, it is tempting to simply compute the proportion of patients who are known to have survived past 20 months, i.e. the proportion of patients for whom _Y >_ 20. This turns out to be 48 _/_ 88, or approximately 55%. However, this does not seem quite right, since _Y_ and _T_ represent different quantities. In particular, 17 of the 40 patients who did not survive to 20 months were actually censored, and this analysis implicitly assumes that _T <_ 20 for all of those censored patients; of course, we do not know whether that is true. 

Alternatively, to estimate _S_ (20), we could consider computing the proportion of patients for whom _Y >_ 20, out of the 71 patients who were _not_ censored by time _t_ = 20; this comes out to 48 _/_ 71, or approximately 68%. However, this is not quite right either, since it amounts to completely ignoring the patients who were censored before time _t_ = 20, even though the _time_ at which they are censored is potentially informative. For instance, a patient who was censored at time _t_ = 19 _._ 9 likely would have survived past _t_ = 20 had he or she not been censored. 

We have seen that estimating _S_ ( _t_ ) is complicated by the presence of censoring. We now present an approach to overcome these challenges. We let _d_ 1 _< d_ 2 _< · · · < dK_ denote the _K_ unique death times among the noncensored patients, and we let _qk_ denote the number of patients who died at time _dk_ . For _k_ = 1 _, . . . , K_ , we let _rk_ denote the number of patients alive

and in the study just before _dk_ ; these are the _at risk_ patients. The set of patients that are at risk at a given time are referred to as the _risk set_ . By the law of total probability,[3] 

$$
\Pr(T > d_k) = \Pr(T > d_k \mid T > d_{k-1}) \Pr(T > d_{k-1}) + \Pr(T > d_k \mid T \le d_{k-1}) \Pr(T \le d_{k-1}) \quad (11.2)
$$

risk set

The fact that _dk−_ 1 _< dk_ implies that Pr( _T > dk|T ≤ dk−_ 1) = 0 (it is impossible for a patient to survive past time _dk_ if he or she did not survive until an earlier time _dk−_ 1). Therefore,

$$
\Pr(T > d_k \mid T \le d_{k-1}) = 0
$$

Plugging in (11.2) again, we see that 

$$
\Pr(T > d_k) = \Pr(T > d_k \mid T > d_{k-1}) \Pr(T > d_{k-1})
$$

This implies that 

$$
S(d_k) = \Pr(T > d_k \mid T > d_{k-1}) \dots \Pr(T > d_2 \mid T > d_1) \Pr(T > d_1) \quad (11.3)
$$

We now must simply plug in estimates of each of the terms on the righthand side of the previous equation. It is natural to use the estimator

$$
\hat{\Pr}(T > d_j \mid T > d_{j-1}) = \frac{n_j - q_j}{n_j} = 1 - \frac{q_j}{n_j}
$$

which is the fraction of the risk set at time _dj_ who survived past time _dj_ . This leads to the _Kaplan–Meier estimator_ of the survival curve:

$$
\hat{S}(d_k) = \prod_{j=1}^k \left( \frac{n_j - q_j}{n_j} \right) \quad (11.4)
$$

Kaplan– Meier estimator 

For times _t_ between _dk_ and _dk_ +1, we set _S_[�] ( _t_ ) = _S_[�] ( _dk_ ). Consequently, the Kaplan–Meier survival curve has a step-like shape. 

The Kaplan–Meier survival curve for the `BrainCancer` data is displayed in Figure 11.2. Each point in the solid step-like curve shows the estimated probability of surviving past the time indicated on the horizontal axis. The estimated probability of survival past 20 months is 71%, which is quite a bit higher than the naive estimates of 55% and 68% presented earlier. 

The sequential construction of the Kaplan–Meier estimator — starting at time zero and mapping out the observed events as they unfold in time — is fundamental to many of the key techniques in survival analysis. These include the log-rank test of Section 11.4, and Cox’s proportional hazard model of Section 11.5.2. 

> 3The law of total probability states that for any two events _A_ and _B_ , Pr( _A_ ) = Pr( _A|B_ ) Pr( _B_ ) + Pr( _A|B[c]_ ) Pr( _B[c]_ ), where _B[c]_ is the complement of the event _B_ , i.e. it is the event that _B_ does not hold.
