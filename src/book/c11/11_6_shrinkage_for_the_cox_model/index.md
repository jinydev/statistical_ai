# 11.6 Shrinkage for the Cox Model 

In this section, we illustrate that the shrinkage methods of Section 6.2 can be applied to the survival data setting. In particular, motivated by the “loss+penalty” formulation of Section 6.2, we consider minimizing a penalized version of the negative log partial likelihood in (11.16),

$$
-\sum_{i : \delta_i = 1} \left( \sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij} \beta_j - \log \left( \sum_{i' : y_{i'} \ge y_i} \exp \left( \sum_{j=1}^p x_{i'j} \beta_j \right) \right) \right) + \lambda P(\beta) \quad (11.17)
$$

with respect to _β_ = ( _β_ 1 _, . . . , βp_ ) _[T]_ . We might take _P_ ( _β_ ) =[�] _[p] j_ =1 _[β] j_[2][,][which] corresponds to a ridge penalty, or _P_ ( _β_ ) =[�] _[p] j_ =1 _[|][β][j][|]_[, which corresponds][to] a lasso penalty. 

In (11.17), _λ_ is a non-negative tuning parameter; typically we will minimize it over a range of values of _λ_ . When _λ_ = 0, then minimizing (11.17) is equivalent to simply maximizing the usual Cox partial likelihood (11.16). However, when _λ >_ 0, then minimizing (11.17) yields a shrunken version of the coefficient estimates. When _λ_ is large, then using a ridge penalty will give small coefficients that are not exactly equal to zero. By contrast, for a

sufficiently large value of _λ_ , using a lasso penalty will give some coefficients that are exactly equal to zero. 

We now apply the lasso-penalized Cox model to the `Publication` data, described in Section 11.5.4. We first randomly split the 244 trials into equallysized training and test sets. The cross-validation results from the training set are shown in Figure 11.7. The “partial likelihood deviance”, shown on the _y_ -axis, is twice the cross-validated negative log partial likelihood; it plays the role of the cross-validation error.[15] Note the “U-shape” of the partial likelihood deviance: just as we saw in previous chapters, the crossvalidation error is minimized for an intermediate level of model complexity. Specifically, this occurs when just two predictors, `budget` and `impact` , have non-zero estimated coefficients. 

Now, how do we apply this model to the test set? This brings up an important conceptual point: in essence, there is no simple way to compare predicted survival times and true survival times on the test set. The first problem is that some of the observations are censored, and so the true survival times for those observations are unobserved. The second issue arises from the fact that in the Cox model, rather than predicting a single survival time given a covariate vector _x_ , we instead estimate an entire survival curve, _S_ ( _t|x_ ), as a function of _t_ . 

Therefore, to assess the model fit, we must take a different approach, which involves stratifying the observations using the coefficient estimates. In particular, for each test observation, we compute the “risk” score

$$
\hat{\eta}_i = \hat{\beta}_{\text{budget}} \cdot x_{i, \text{budget}} + \hat{\beta}_{\text{impact}} \cdot x_{i, \text{impact}}
$$

where _β_[ˆ] budget and _β_[ˆ] impact are the coefficient estimates for these two features from the training set. We then use these risk scores to categorize the observations based on their “risk”. For instance, the high risk group consists of the observations for which budget _i · β_[ˆ] budget + impact _i · β_[ˆ] impact is largest; by

**FIGURE 11.7.** _For the_ `Publication` _data described in Section 11.5.4, cross-validation results for the lasso-penalized Cox model are shown. The y-axis displays the partial likelihood deviance, which plays the role of the cross-validation error. The x-axis displays the ℓ_ 1 _norm (that is, the sum of the absolute values) of the coefficients of the lasso-penalized Cox model with tuning parameter λ, divided by the ℓ_ 1 _norm of the coefficients of the unpenalized Cox model. The dashed line indicates the minimum cross-validation error._ 

(11.14), we see that these are the observations for which the instantaneous probability of being published at any moment in time is largest. In other words, the high risk group consists of the trials that are likely to be published sooner. On the `Publication` data, we stratify the observations into tertiles of low, medium, and high risk. The resulting survival curves for each of the three strata are displayed in Figure 11.8. We see that there is clear separation between the three strata, and that the strata are correctly ordered in terms of low, medium, and high risk of publication.
