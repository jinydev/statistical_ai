# Comparing the Lasso and Ridge Regression 

It is clear that the lasso has a major advantage over ridge regression, in that it produces simpler and more interpretable models that involve only a subset of the predictors. However, which method leads to better prediction accuracy? Figure 6.8 displays the variance, squared bias, and test $\text{MSE}$ of the lasso applied to the same simulated data as in Figure 6.5. Clearly the lasso leads to qualitatively similar behavior to ridge regression, in that as $\lambda$ increases, the variance decreases and the bias increases. In the right-hand

panel of Figure 6.8, the dotted lines represent the ridge regression fits. Here we plot both against their $R^2$ on the training data. This is another useful way to index models, and can be used to compare models with different types of regularization, as is the case here. In this example, the lasso and ridge regression result in almost identical biases. However, the variance of ridge regression is slightly lower than the variance of the lasso. Consequently, the minimum $\text{MSE}$ of ridge regression is slightly smaller than that of the lasso. 

However, the data in Figure 6.8 were generated in such a way that all 45 predictors were related to the response—that is, none of the true coefficients $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_{45}$ equaled zero. The lasso implicitly assumes that a number of the coefficients truly equal zero. Consequently, it is not surprising that ridge regression outperforms the lasso in terms of prediction error in this setting. Figure 6.9 illustrates a similar situation, except that now the response is a function of only 2 out of 45 predictors. Now the lasso tends to outperform ridge regression in terms of bias, variance, and MSE. 

These two examples illustrate that neither ridge regression nor the lasso will universally dominate the other. In general, one might expect the lasso to perform better in a setting where a relatively small number of predictors have substantial coefficients, and the remaining predictors have coefficients that are very small or that equal zero. Ridge regression will perform better when the response is a function of many predictors, all with coefficients of roughly equal size. However, the number of predictors that is related to the response is never known _a priori_ for real data sets. A technique such as cross-validation can be used in order to determine which approach is better on a particular data set. 

As with ridge regression, when the least squares estimates have excessively high variance, the lasso solution can yield a reduction in variance at the expense of a small increase in bias, and consequently can generate more accurate predictions. Unlike ridge regression, the lasso performs variable selection, and hence results in models that are easier to interpret.

**FIGURE 6.9.** Left: _Plots of squared bias (black), variance (green), and test $\text{MSE}$ (purple) for the lasso. The simulated data is similar to that in Figure 6.8, except that now only two predictors are related to the response._ Right: _Comparison of squared bias, variance, and test $\text{MSE}$ between lasso (solid) and ridge (dotted). Both are plotted against their $R^2$ on the training data, as a common form of indexing. The crosses in both plots indicate the lasso model for which the $\text{MSE}$ is smallest._ 

There are very efficient algorithms for fitting both ridge and lasso models; in both cases the entire coefficient paths can be computed with about the same amount of work as a single least squares fit. We will explore this further in the lab at the end of this chapter.
