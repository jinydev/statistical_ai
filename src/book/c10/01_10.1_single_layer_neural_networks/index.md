# 10.1 Single Layer Neural Networks 

A neural network takes an input vector of _p_ variables _X_ = ( _X_ 1 _, X_ 2 _, . . . , Xp_ ) and builds a nonlinear function _f_ ( _X_ ) to predict the response _Y_ . We have built nonlinear prediction models in earlier chapters, using trees, boosting and generalized additive models. What distinguishes neural networks from these methods is the particular _structure_ of the model. Figure 10.1 shows a simple _feed-forward neural network_ for modeling a quantitative response feed-forward using _p_ = 4 predictors. In the terminology of neural networks, the four feaneural tures _X_ 1 _, . . . , X_ 4 make up the units in the _input layer_ . The arrows indicate network that each of the inputs from the input layer feeds into each of the _K hidden_ input layer _units_ (we get to pick _K_ ; here we chose 5). The neural network model has the form

$$
f(X) = \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_k g \left( w_{k0} + \sum_{j=1}^p w_{kj} X_j \right) \quad (10.3)
$$


It is built up here in two steps. First the _K activations Ak, k_ = 1 _, . . . , K,_ in activations the hidden layer are computed as functions of the input features _X_ 1 _, . . . , Xp_ ,

$$
A_k = h_k(X) = g \left( w_{k0} + \sum_{j=1}^p w_{kj} X_j \right) \quad (10.2)
$$

where _g_ ( _z_ ) is a nonlinear _activation function_ that is specified in advance. activation We can think of each _Ak_ as a different transformation _hk_ ( _X_ ) of the original function features, much like the basis functions of Chapter 7. These _K_ activations from the hidden layer then feed into the output layer, resulting in

$$
f(X) = \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_k A_k \quad (10.1)
$$

a linear regression model in the _K_ = 5 activations. All the parameters _β_ 0 _, . . . , βK_ and _w_ 10 _, . . . , wKp_ need to be estimated from data. In the early instances of neural networks, the _sigmoid_ activation function was favored,

$$
g(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \quad (10.4)
$$


which is the same function used in logistic regression to convert a linear function into probabilities between zero and one (see Figure 10.2). The preferred choice in modern neural networks is the _ReLU_ ( _rectified linear_ ReLU _unit_ ) activation function, which takes the form 

$$
g(z) = (z)_+ = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } z < 0 \\ z & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \quad (10.5)
$$


A ReLU activation can be computed and stored more efficiently than a sigmoid activation. Although it thresholds at zero, because we apply it to a linear function (10.2) the constant term _wk_ 0 will shift this inflection point. So in words, the model depicted in Figure 10.1 derives five new features by computing five different linear combinations of _X_ , and then squashes each through an activation function _g_ ( _·_ ) to transform it. The final model is linear in these derived variables. 

The name _neural network_ originally derived from thinking of these hidden units as analogous to neurons in the brain — values of the activations _Ak_ = _hk_ ( _X_ ) close to one are _firing_ , while those close to zero are _silent_ (using the sigmoid activation function). 

_·_ The nonlinearity in the activation function _g_ ( ) is essential, since without it the model _f_ ( _X_ ) in (10.1) would collapse into a simple linear model in

_X_ 1 _, . . . , Xp_ . Moreover, having a nonlinear activation function allows the model to capture complex nonlinearities and interaction effects. Consider a very simple example with _p_ = 2 input variables _X_ = ( _X_ 1 _, X_ 2), and _K_ = 2 hidden units _h_ 1( _X_ ) and _h_ 2( _X_ ) with _g_ ( _z_ ) = _z_[2] . We specify the other parameters as 

$$
\beta_0 = 0, \beta_1 = \frac{1}{4}, \beta_2 = -\frac{1}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad \begin{pmatrix} w_{11} & w_{12} \\ w_{21} & w_{22} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

From (10.2), this means that 

$$
A_1 = (X_1 + X_2)^2 \quad \text{and} \quad A_2 = (X_1 - X_2)^2 \quad (10.7)
$$

Then plugging (10.7) into (10.1), we get

$$
f(X) = \frac{1}{4}(X_1 + X_2)^2 - \frac{1}{4}(X_1 - X_2)^2 = X_1 X_2 \quad (10.8)
$$

So the sum of two nonlinear transformations of linear functions can give us an interaction! In practice we would not use a quadratic function for _g_ ( _z_ ), since we would always get a second-degree polynomial in the original coordinates _X_ 1 _, . . . , Xp_ . The sigmoid or ReLU activations do not have such a limitation. 

Fitting a neural network requires estimating the unknown parameters in (10.1). For a quantitative response, typically squared-error loss is used, so that the parameters are chosen to minimize

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2
$$

Details about how to perform this minimization are provided in Section 10.7.
